# Team Swamp

We started as a small group of 3 developers, but we grew into a big friend group with developers, artists, designers and even musicians.

In this organization we focus on making games with each other. 
For now, we only have projects made in Unity and worked with the language c#, but we want to expand our knowlegde by trying out new engines and other languages.
